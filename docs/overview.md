## Overview

Remote monitoring and diagnostics (RM&D) applications are used in industries to monitor machines to report irregularities in operation and analyze patterns of behavior and performance over time. Monitoring and diagnostic applications use a set of algorithms, processes, and tools to monitor the health of an asset and detect faults before they turn into failures.

This RM&D reference app is a good starting point for understanding Predix cloud application development.  This app was created from a fork of the Predix Experience Seed app, then the user interface was customized for the needs of RM&D.  The app also demonstrates how you can:

* Integrate your backend services
* Model assets and meters
* Ingest data into time series
* Customize your user interface
* Secure your application using Predix authentication service
* Use Predix Contextual Dashboard to browse assets
* Use Predix widgets - Data Grid, and Time-series
* Integrate Predix cloud services - Asset, Time Series, UAA, ACS, Analytics
* Visualize Predix Machine live data
